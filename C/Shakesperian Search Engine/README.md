# Shakespearian Search Engine


Grace Street 

I did not work on this project with anyone.
Honor Code: On my honor I have not given nor received nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.

This project involves creating a Hashmap to add words, the posistions in the play that they occur, and the sentences that they appear in, when given the full text files of the plays.

Only includes the text files for Hamlet, Midsummer Night's Dream, and Romeo & Juliet.

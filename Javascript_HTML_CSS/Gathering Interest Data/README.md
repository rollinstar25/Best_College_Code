# Project 4: Something Awesome

## You may work with a partner on this project.

## Description

This is it, the final project. As promised, this is your chance to use the tools we've studied during this semester to create something awesome.

The requirements are:

- Awesomeness.

- Uses web programming tools (JavaScript, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, FireBase, NodeJS and Express, etc.)

You have broad freedom to build pretty much whatever you want, but it must be a dynamic application (no static websites).

You have some time to work on this, but not a ton, so keep the scope reasonable. Focus on core functionaltiy first, then add features once you have the basics implemented.

## Submission

Come demo your project to me during finals week, no later than 4 PM Friday, December 14. Note that I have finals in my other classes that morning.

You must also turn in a **two-page written summary** of your application. The document should summarize what you built, the design decisions you made, and give an overview of the important parts of the code.

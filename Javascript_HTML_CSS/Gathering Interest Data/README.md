#Gathering Interest Data from a Website
This was an opened assignment to combine everything we had learned that semester.
So I chose to create a program to gather information from what people clicked and how long they stayed on a page to give a "rating" or "score" for different items. I created a mock website for custom Elves on Shelves and when the site is active it would gather the information as user interacts with each page and stored it in a database.

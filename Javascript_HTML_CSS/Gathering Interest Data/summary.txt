The ultimate goal of this project is to make a program to measure others interest in products on a website.
Basically:
    1. Each product has an HTML page from which data is collected. 
        -The amount of time spent on a page
        -If the user pressed "buy"
    2. When the webpage is closed, it should send all the data collected to the database
    
Issues:
    1. How to tell when the webpage is closed?
    2. How to avoid an infinte loop when creating the timer?
    Because the webpage will freeze if there is one
    3. Figuring out my image paths( its a silly problem, but I can't figure it out)

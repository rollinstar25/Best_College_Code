# Turtle Clicker Game

This project is supposed to open a web based clicker game where you are trying to flip a turtle over it would count down and count the number of clicks in that time period. It does that much at least, but I had originally intended to make it progressively get harder( more time per level) and it would keep track of high scores per level in a database, adding a competive edge to it.

# Project 2: Minimum Viable Product

## Due Tuesday, October 23, IN CLASS

## You may work with a partner on this project.

## Description

In the startup world, a minimum viable product (MVP) is the rough-and-ready prototype designed to test the validity of an idea. The MVP concept encourages designers to create a product that has a limited set of necessary features, but no more than what's required to see if users are actually interested.

In this project, you're going to create your own implementation of a web application of your choice. Use Bootstrap for layout and Firebase
for data management.

You have broad freedom to pick anything that you want to create. Here are some ideas:

- Blogging or microblogging sites like Tumblr

- Social profile sites like LinkedIn

- Chat / instant messaging apps like Slack

- Image sharing / tagging

- Addictive clicker / incremental games like Cookie Clicker

- To-do or task-management applications

Whatever you build, it must be interactive and use the features we've been discussing in class. Your project cannot be a static website.

Whatever you choose, don't expect to replicate all of its features. Keep the scope reasonable. You **must** build incrementally and push copies of your work to GitHub regularly.

## Presentation

October 23 will be **in-class Demo Day**. You and your partner (if you work with one) will have **two minutes** to give an overview of your application and **three minutes** for a live demo. You may use a deck of **at most three slides** in your overview.

This may seem incredibly short, but this abbreviated pitch-and-demo style is common in Silicon Valley startup incubators.

## Grading

50 points for technical content. This includes:

- Reasonable grid layout in Bootstrap.

- Use of JavaScript and interactive page elements.

- Use of one or more Firebase features. You will probably use the database, but you aren't required to use authentication if your 
project doesn't require it.

50 points for the presentation. This includes:

- Organization and clarity

- Presentaton and speaking style (you don't need to dress up).

- Staying within time and slide limits.

- Emphasizing one or two key points about your application you want the audience to take away.

## Tips

It may seem like you have a lot of time, but don't wait until the last week to start hacking. You're going to need some experimentation with this project to figure what you should build.

It's likely that your first attempt will teach you what **not** to do, so you can then go and build the right thing on the second try. Plan for this in advance.

Try to make it look good, but don't obsess about appearance until you have the key functionality going. Create a simple Bootstrap grid as a skeleton and use that while you're working out the logic of the app.

You can add additional pages **if you need to**. For example, you might have a landing page with sign-on options that redirects to the 
main page once the user authenticates. If you do create multiple pages, you'll need to add lines to `app.js` to serve them.

Using documentation and searching for examples are essential skills for this project. Google everything you don't understand.

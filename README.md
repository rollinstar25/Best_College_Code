Final project 
Create an improved registration website for college courses.
This was a group effort and I played a rather small role in this. I mainly worked on the front end, assisting in the design and aesthetic, debugging and being a scrum master. All the backend and a lot of the funtionality was created by the others in my group(Rene Borr, Brandt Smith, Kenny Nguyen, and Chris Johnson)
